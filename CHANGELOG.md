# Changelog

## [0.12.1] - 2024-02-19

### Updated Dependencies

- Updated all corresponding dependencies to their latest versions.

## [0.12.0] - 2024-02-19

### Added

- New method `clearByJS` in case Playwright's clear function doesn't work as expected. This method provides an alternative way to clear input fields using JavaScript.
- `clickAndNavigate` function now throws a more descriptive error message to facilitate easier debugging.
- Added new method `fillAndTab` in `action-utils` for filling input fields and simulating a tab press, improving form handling automation.
- New method `getContext` added in `page-utils`, offering a straightforward way to retrieve the browser context for advanced testing scenarios.

### Changed

- `pressKeyboard` function is now divided into `pressPageKeyboard` and `pressLocatorKeyboard` functions to provide more targeted keyboard interaction capabilities. This change allows for more precise control over where keyboard inputs are sent, whether to the page or specific element locators.

### Breaking Changes

- Splitting `pressKeyboard` into `pressPageKeyboard` and `pressLocatorKeyboard` may require updates to existing tests that utilize the original `pressKeyboard` method. This modification aims to enhance test script specificity and efficiency but will necessitate changes to maintain compatibility.

### Enhancements

- **`acceptAlert`, `dismissAlert`, `getAlertText` Function**: Improved the functions to efficiently handle the alert dialogs. It now ensures that the function does not hang if an alert is not triggered after the specified timeout period.

### Added

- **`expectAlertToHaveText` Function**: Introduced a new function for asserting that the text from an alert dialog exactly matches a provided string.

- **`expectAlertToMatchText` Function**: Added a new function that allows assertions against the text from an alert dialog to be made using either a string for partial matches or a regular expression for pattern matching.
